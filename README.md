# AHK-Scripts

A set of useful functions written with AutoHotKey to automate frequently done tasks or add custom shortcuts. Works on Windows.

## List of customs Hotkeys and HotStrings

- Navigate with mouse wheel in AltTab interface
- Brightness adjust with `Win` + Wheel
- Instant app launcher and switcher with `Alt` + `&`, `Alt` + `é`, `Alt` + `"`
- `alt` to activate window under mouse 
- Grab the scrollbar of any window with one shortcut (`MouseButton2`)
- Close window with middle mouse button in the taskbar
- Copy the path to a file with `ctrl` `shift` `c` in file explorer
- Open any file with Notepad++ in file explorer with `Ctrl` + `W`
- Create a new file named... with `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `n` when in file explorer

## Limitations
You can use and edit this file as you want but these shortcuts are designed for my use and will not work properly 
with every program or every users. You will probably have to rewrite some of of them.
